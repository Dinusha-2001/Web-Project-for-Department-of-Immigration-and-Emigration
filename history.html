		<h1>History of Immigration & Emigration and Citizenship of Sri Lanka</h1>
		<h2>Immigration & Emigration before Independence</h2>
		<p>To be the best immigration service in the region</p>
 		
		<p>During the period when Ceylon was a British colony, entry into and exit from Sri Lanka
		(then Ceylon) was controlled by the following ordinances:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Emigration of Indians from Ceylon Ordinance no 3 of 1847</li>
			<li>Foreign Recruiting Ordinance no 01 of 1874</li>
			<li>Ceylon emigrants Ordinance no 04 of 1882</li>
			<li>Destitute Immigrants Ordinance no 12 of 1907</li>
			<li>Emigration Ordinance no 22 of 1917</li>
			<li>Passport Ordinance no 20 of 1923</li>
			<li>Aliens Registration Ordinance no 30 of 1935</li>
			<li>Indian Criminal Tribes Immigration Ordinance no 19 of 1939</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p><strong>Emigration of Indians from Ceylon Ordinance 1847 </strong>has been enacted to, prohibit natives of India from, entering into contracts in Ceylon, for labor to be performed 
		in any British or foreign colony beyond the limits of India or Ceylon, and from emigrating, from Ceylon to any such colony, for the purpose of employment as laborers.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Foreign Recruiting Ordinance 1874 </strong>was enacted to, control recruiting in Ceylon, for the service of foreign states. BY this law, governor was authorized to, prohibit recruiting 
		persons, for service of foreign states beyond the limits of Ceylon; or permit to do so subject to conditions.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><strong>Ceylon Emigrants Ordinance 1882</strong> was enacted to; regulate the emigration of Ceylonese laborers from, Ceylon under contract of service. By this law, governor was empowered to,
		declare places where Ceylonese laborers were allowed to, emigrate. It was subject to the condition that such contracts should be signed before a magistrate.</p>

		<p><strong>Destitute Immigrants Ordinance1907</strong> was enacted to, restrict immigration into Ceylon of destitute, and vicious persons, and of stowaways. The main objective of this law was, 
		preventing the entry of persons, who would be a liability to the Treasury. By this law a person other than a native of Ceylon or native of British India, &nbsp; who was unable, by reason of physical
		or mental infirmity, to maintain himself by his own labor, or is destitute, was not permitted to land. Entry of such a person was permitted only on a bond entered into by a local to the effect that 
		he would repay to the financial secretary any cost and charges, may be incurred in respect of such destitute immigrant. The entry into Ceylon of any prostitute or any person living on the prostitution,
		too was prohibited by this law.</p>

		<p><strong>Emigration ordinance 1917</strong> was enacted to regulate the emigration of persons from Ceylon for the purpose of employment in certain capacities outside the island. In this law emigrant
		was defined as a native person living in Ceylon and Indian emigrant was defined as a native person of India, other than a person who has obtained a pass under any law in force in British India regulating
		the issue of passes to Indian emigrants.Provision was made in this law to, both emigrants and Indian emigrants to obtain the consent of chief secretary in writing for embarkation. Only the persons who were 
		over seventeen years of age were granted with consent. They were required to obtain a pass from the collector of customs and enter into a bond with the crown. Further they had to keep a deposit of three 
		hundred rupees with the collector of customs. The persons who were emigrating for employment purposes had to sign a service contract with their employer, and it should have been attested by the controller 
		of customs. In addition to that, there were several provisions, regards to the responsibilities of masters of ships, powers of police officers to search and arrest, and medical examinations at the port, 
		and penalties.</p>

		<p><strong>Passport Ordinance 1923</strong> was enacted to make provision to take power to require passports of persons entering or departing from Ceylon. The governor was granted with powers to make
		regulations requiring that persons entering or departing from Ceylon should be on possession of passports, and matters related to that purpose. Further, he was empowered, to exempt of any person or 
		class of persons from any provision of such regulations. The regulations made under this law were effected up to October 28 of 1949, until the &nbsp;new immigration and emigration regulations make 
		under the immigrants and emigrants act no 20 of 1948, came into effect.</p>

		<p>Aliens’ Registration Ordinance 1935 was enacted to make provision for the registration of aliens (a person other than a British subject or British protected person) in Ceylon. 
		The registrar of aliens was appointed by the governor under the provision of this law. By this law, any alien who was intending to remain in the island for a period of one month or longer was
		ordered to furnish a return to the registrar. Further there was provision regards to the, restrictions of movements within the island, deportation of aliens, and verification of returns.
		So it was something similar to the visa requirements of present day.</p>

		<p><strong>Indian criminal tribes immigration ordinance no.19 of 1939</strong></p>

		<p>This ordinance was enacted by state council, and assented by his majesty the king on 1939.05.23 to restrict the immigration of Indian criminal tribes in to Ceylon.
		Those days there were some tribes organized as gangs and engaged with criminal activities in India. They were commonly known as Thugs and were declared as criminal tribes
		by the laws in force in India at that time. By this ordinance the governor of Ceylon was empowered to declare such tribes as criminal tribes in Ceylon by notification.
		The entry in to Ceylon of such tribes was prohibited without a permit. Provisions were made relating to the removal, arrest, penalties for abetting, and taking fingerprints 
		of such persons by this ordinance. The chief secretary was empowered to make regulations pertaining to the restrictions.</p>

		<p>This ordinance was in force until 1948 and it was repealed by the immigrants and emigrants act no 20 of 1948.</p>

		<p><strong>Immigration &amp; emigration After independence</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Immigrants and Emigrants Act No. 20 of 1948</strong></p>

		<p>After gaining Independence from British, the then Parliament promulgated the Immigrants and Emigrants Act No. 20 of 1948. It was assented on October 6, 1948 and came into effect on 1 November 1949.
		In this Act, provisions was made, to control of entry and remain of non-Ceylonese,&nbsp;&nbsp; to regulate the departure from Ceylon the citizens, and persons&nbsp; other than&nbsp;&nbsp; 
		the citizens of Ceylon ,&nbsp; to&nbsp;remove or deport&nbsp; non-Ceylonese who have committed offences under the act or who are undesirables, to supervise the activities of non Ceylonese during 
		their stay in Ceylon, and to organize the administrative set-up for the implementation of the above objectives and matters incidental thereto and connected therein. Regulations made under the 
		Act were published in the <strong>Gazette no 10039 issued on 28 October 1949</strong></p>

		<p>Emigration of Indians from Ceylon ordinance, foreign recruiting ordinance, Indian criminal tribes’ immigration ordinance, Destitute Immigrants Ordinance, 
		Emigration ordinance, Passport Ordinance, Aliens registration ordinance, &amp; Ceylon emigrants’ ordinance, were repealed by this law.</p>

		<p>Immigrants and Emigrants Act No. 20 of 1948 has been amended at several occasions by the <strong>Amendment Acts no 16 of 1955, no 68 of 1961, no 16 of 1993, no 42 of 1998, and no 31 of
		2006 and no. 07 of 2015 </strong>respectively.</p>

		<p>Significant changes made by these amendments were as follows.</p>

		<p>Provisions on permanent &amp; temporary residents permits of main act were repealed and resident visa provisions were included instead of them by the <strong>Amendment Act no 16 of 1955.</strong></p>

		<p>The governor general was empowered to authorize any member of the forces to exercise and discharge powers and duties under the immigrants and emigrants act, by the <strong>Amendment Act no 68 of 1961.
		</strong> The aim of this amendment was to stop illicit immigrant entering into the country.</p>

		<p>The Authority prescribed to issue or renew passports were empowered to take finger printing for the inclusion in the passport, from a person applying for a passport or the renewal of a passport, 
		by the Amendment Act no 07 of 2015</p>

		<p>In 1972 Ceylon became a republic. The name of the country was changed as the democratic socialist republic of Sri Lanka. After that, immigrants and emigrants act has been amended thrice, in 1993,
		1998, and 2006 respectively. All those occasions it was regard to restrict illicit emigrants from Sri Lanka as well as illicit immigrants remain in Sri Lanka.</p>

		<p>In addition to that following related laws were enacted for specific purposes mentioned below.</p>

		<p><strong>Temporary Residence Tax Act no 15 of 1971</strong> was enacted to; make provision for the levy and recovery of a tax computed with reference to the stay in Sri Lanka of certain persons
		who are not citizens of Sri Lanka.</p>

		<p><strong>Passport (regulations) and Exit Permit Act no 53 of 1971</strong> was enacted to provide for regulation and control of the issue and renewal of passports; for the issue of exit permits
		to citizen of Sri Lanka; and to impose an obligation on citizens of Sri Lanka employed abroad to remit a part of their earnings in foreign exchange to Sri Lanka.</p>

		<p><strong>Resident Guest (tax exemption) Act no 06 of 1979</strong> was enacted to exempt certain categories of resident visa holders from certain taxes. Resident guests were granted with above 
		exemption by this law.</p>

		<p><strong>Department of Immigration and Emigration</strong></p>

		<p>With the enactment of the immigration &amp; emigration act, the necessity was aroused to establish a new department to implement the provisions of it. This new Department was established in 
		October 1949 and started in Colombo Fort. The Assistant Secretary of the Ministry of Defense was transferred together with his staff to the newly formed Department. Police Department, 
		which attended to the field duties, was requested to hand over of those functions to the newly formed Department.&nbsp; The implementation of the new law was postponed until 01st November 1949
		till relief arrangements were made effected to those affected by the new Act. The practice of issuing British Passports to Citizens of Sri Lanka was stopped with effect from 01.11.1949.
		The New Ceylon Passport came into use from then, and the holder had to be a Citizen of Ceylon.</p>
